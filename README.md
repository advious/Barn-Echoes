# Barn-Echoes

An introductory USACO Bronze-level problem about a barn of cows that like hearing their moos.

## Description:

The cows enjoy mooing at the barn because their moos echo back,
although sometimes not completely. Bessie, ever the excellent
secretary, has been recording the exact wording of the moo as it
goes out and returns. She is curious as to just how much overlap
there is.

Given two lines of input (letters from the set a..z, total length
in the range of 1..80), each of which has the wording of a moo on it,
determine the greatest number of characters of overlap between one
string and the other. A string is an overlap between two other
strings if it is a prefix of one string and a suffix of the other
string.
